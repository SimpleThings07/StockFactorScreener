Stock Factor Screener

Multiâ€‘factor quality, value & growth screening for equity portfolios, built with Python, yfinance & AlphaÂ Vantage.

Overview

StockFactorScreener.py automates collection, normalisation and scoring of fundamental metrics for a list of stock tickers. It produces:

Value metrics â€“ Forward/TrailingÂ Pâ€‘E, Priceâ€‘toâ€‘Book, EBITÂ / Totalâ€‘Enterpriseâ€‘Value

Profitability metrics â€“ ROE, ROA, Grossâ€‘Profitâ€‘toâ€‘AssetsÂ (GPOA), GrossÂ ProfitÂ MarginÂ (GPMAR), Cashâ€‘Flowâ€‘overâ€‘AssetsÂ (CFOA)

Growth metrics â€“ CAGR of EPS, GPOA, ROE, ROA, CFOA, GPMAR plus earnings variabilityÂ (EVAR)

Optional factorÂ Zâ€‘scores across Value, Profitability & Growth

A timestamped Excel workbook with all raw metrics and portfolio weights

Detailed logs for full traceability

Primary data comes from YahooÂ Finance with AlphaÂ Vantage as the fallâ€‘back source. Heavy requests are processed concurrently using Pythonâ€™s ThreadPoolExecutor.

Features

âš¡Â Threadâ€‘pool concurrency for faster data retrieval

ðŸ”§Â Pluggable JSON config â€“ change tickers, weights, lookâ€‘back periods & API keys without editing code

ðŸ“ŠÂ Excel output suited for further analysis or portfolio construction

ðŸªµÂ Rich, configurable logging via Logging_config.json

ðŸ“¦Â Selfâ€‘contained â€“ no database or external services beyond data APIs

QuickÂ start

git clone https://github.com/<yourâ€‘org>/stockâ€‘factorâ€‘screener.git
cd stockâ€‘factorâ€‘screener
python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate   # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
cp ScreenerConfig.example.json ScreenerConfig.json  # edit with your API key & tickers
python StockFactorScreener.py

A new Excel workbook will appear in the gen/ folder when the run completes.

Requirements

Python 3.10.4

Install them in one go:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Configuration (ScreenerConfig.json)

{
  "AlphaVantage": {
    "API_Key": "YOUR_ALPHA_VANTAGE_KEY",
    "Base_URL": "https://www.alphavantage.co/query"
  },
  "Earnings_Period": 5,
  "Tickers_and_Weights": [
    { "ticker": "AAPL", "weight": 0.10 },
    { "ticker": "MSFT", "weight": 0.08 }
  ],
  "Stock_Quality_Excel_Filename": "S&P600_Quality"
}

API_Key â€“ free keys available at alphavantage.co

Earnings_Period â€“ lookâ€‘back window (years) for growth/variability metrics

Tickers_and_Weights â€“ initial portfolio weights used in output tables

Stock_Quality_Excel_Filename â€“ base filename for Excel reports in gen/

Logging

Behaviour is controlled by Logging_config.json (standard logging dictConfig). By default a rolling file named StockFactorScreener.log is created alongside the script.

Output

Excel workbook: gen/YYYY-MM-DD_<baseâ€‘name>.xlsx

One row per ticker with all raw & derived metrics

Original portfolio weights preserved

Log file: stepâ€‘byâ€‘step trace, API diagnostics and runtime stats

Roadmap

Add CLI flags (--config, --threads, etc.)

Publish Docker image for reproducible deployments

Integrate composite MSCIâ€‘style factor scores

Unit tests (pytest) & GitHubÂ Actions CI
